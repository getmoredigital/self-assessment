# Self-Assessment

After some years of professional programming of differing challenges in different frameworks
and languages, as well as, formal and informal education in theory. I have found it difficult to accurately 
self assessment one's familiarity and comfort with the many different aspects of programming contexts.
Instead of finding someone else's standard or using indirect metrics, I have decided to create and evolve my own standard 
with the long-term aim of allowing for an assessment platform for use by both myself and others.

## Starting Point

I have started a general list of programming concepts and skills that I believe are important to be familiar with organized
into a hierarchy of categories. I will endeavour to rate myself over time, eventually expanding to include other key technologies 
such as CSS, git, Docker etc.

A score will thus be between 0-6, where 0 is no knowledge and 6 is expert knowledge. 
The final score will be a floating point.
And in the long term, the system can suggest areas to focus learning and micro-projects to work on.

### General Outline
**Level 0** Taken a general interest in a topic, framework, library, or language.

**Level 1** Basic syntax and semantics

Can one express:
- *control logic*: start, stop, repeat, condition, escape, pipe, etc.
- *represent primitives*: function, integer, float, character, string, null, binaries, etc
- *transformations*: casting, conversion, etc
- *control access*: public, private
- *encapsulate*: create and retrieve
- *iterate*: loops, recursion
- *iterative behaviors* search, filter, sort, split, get, add, delete, modify, reduce
- *basic math operations*: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, etc
- *basic math relations*: power, root, log, sqrt, ceiling, floor, etc
- *basic data structures*: array, list, dictionary, set, etc
- *check constraints*: isNumber, isString, isNull, etc
- *limit changes*: readonly, mutable, etc
- *error handle*: can express, can identify, can recover
- *Structure data*: list, map, higher-order functions
- *Behavior*: pass by value, pass by reference, etc


**Level 2** Gaining confidence by building some projects

Can one:
- I/O
- Parse outside data
- use concurrent operations
- Scheduled operations
- DateTime operations
- Fetch from API
- Utilize database
- Encrypt Data
- Compile, package or deploy
- Restrict access
- *create a project*: e.g. setup, configure, etc
- *manage dependencies*: e.g. install, update, remove, etc
- *write tests*: e.g. unit, integration, end-to-end, etc
- *debug*: e.g. identify, isolate, fix, etc
- *auto-document*: e.g. code, project, etc
- *optimize*: e.g. performance, memory, etc

**Level 3** Can demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic and develop in without review step
- *evidence* a public repository with demonstration
...

**Level 4** Able to build a quality project with others
...

**Level 5** Advanced understanding of the topic
...
